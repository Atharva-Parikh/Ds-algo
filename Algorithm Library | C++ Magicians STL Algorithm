For all those who aspire to excel in competitive programming, only having a knowledge about containers of STL is of less use till one is not aware what all STL has to offer.

STL has an ocean of algorithms, for all < algorithm > library functions : Refer here.

Some of the most used algorithms on vectors and most useful one’s in Competitive Programming are mentioned as follows :

Non-Manipulating Algorithms

sort(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To sort the given vector.
reverse(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To reverse a vector.
*max_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the maximum element of a vector.
*min_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the minimum element of a vector.
accumulate(first_iterator, last_iterator, initial value of sum) – Does the summation of vector elements

// A C++ program to demonstrate working of sort(), 
// reverse() 
#include <algorithm> 
#include <iostream> 
#include <vector> 
#include <numeric> //For accumulate operation 
using namespace std; 
  
int main() 
{ 
    // Initializing vector with array values 
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 5, 23 ,42 , 15}; 
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); 
    vector<int> vect(arr, arr+n); 
  
    cout << "Vector is: "; 
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) 
        cout << vect[i] << " "; 
  
    // Sorting the Vector in Ascending order 
    sort(vect.begin(), vect.end()); 
  
    cout << "\nVector after sorting is: "; 
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) 
       cout << vect[i] << " "; 
  
    // Reversing the Vector 
    reverse(vect.begin(), vect.end()); 
  
    cout << "\nVector after reversing is: "; 
    for (int i=0; i<6; i++) 
        cout << vect[i] << " "; 
  
    cout << "\nMaximum element of vector is: "; 
    cout << *max_element(vect.begin(), vect.end()); 
  
    cout << "\nMinimum element of vector is: "; 
    cout << *min_element(vect.begin(), vect.end()); 
  
    // Starting the summation from 0 
    cout << "\nThe summation of vector elements is: "; 
    cout << accumulate(vect.begin(), vect.end(), 0); 
  
    return 0; 
} 
Output:



Vector before sorting is: 10 20 5 23 42 15 
Vector after sorting is: 5 10 15 20 23 42 
Vector before reversing is: 5 10 15 20 23 42 
Vector after reversing is: 42 23 20 15 10 5 
Maximum element of vector is: 42
Minimum element of vector is: 5
The summation of vector elements is: 115
